For inspiration, check out [Salesforce's Lightning Design System accessibility guidelines](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/guidelines/accessibility/), and be sure to check out the fantastic [a11yproject](http://a11yproject.com) for an accessibility checklist, patterns, and resources.

# The Importance of Web Accessibility
Web accessibility is but a single component of [universal design](http://universaldesign.ie/What-is-Universal-Design/). It ensures that web user interfaces and contents are usable by "all people regardless of age, size, ability or disability."

Accessibility relies on best practices for content (e.g., using properly nested heading hierarchy in an article) and technology (e.g., adherence to [WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)).

## Legal Implications
There are [several US laws](https://webaim.org/articles/laws/usa/) that apply to accessibility requirements. While [Section 508 of the Rehabilitiation Act of 1973](https://www.section508.gov/) provides legislation enforcing accessibility practices among federal agencies, the [Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/) is a civil rights legislation that ensures anyone with a disability has an equal opportunity to participate in programs, services, and activities, which includes communications with persons with disabilities and accommodations. Under the ADA, an individual with a disability can file suit against an organization for lack of accessible accomodations provided through its website.
