title: Getting Started
description: The getting started page should provide information for how to get up and running with the design system. 

---

This page should provide an overview about what the purpose of design system is and how its intended to be used by end users. This section should also provide some insight into what sort of things can be found within the style guide and where users should go to look for that content.

## Support and Community

Provide information on where people can go to [ask for help]({{site.baseurl}}/support), and provide a link to the [contribution page]({{site.baseurl}}/contributions) to help give back to the system.

# Showcase

This may be a good place to also showcase websites and applications that have been created using the design system. This helps provide credibility to the system, incentivizes teams to use the system, and provides a handy reference to see components in the wild. Check out a [gallery of apps created with Material Design](https://material.uplabs.com/) for inspiration.
