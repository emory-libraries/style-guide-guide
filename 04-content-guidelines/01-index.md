Content guidelines is where you'll find UX guidance for specific aspects of the app or site design, such as navigation models, data entry, form validation, notifications and alerts, and so on. These will give high-level tours of the relevant components and styles, with links to the specific pages in the components and styles sections for more detailed guidelines on each element. Each guideline is effectively an article on good usage.
