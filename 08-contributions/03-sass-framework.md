description: This page provides information about the design system's Sass framework and what's included within it

Use this page to explain the purpose of the Sass framework and how to use it. Here would also be a good place to link to any SassDocs or design system tokens, like [Salesforce's Lightning Design System design tokens](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/).
