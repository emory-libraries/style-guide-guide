title: Contributions
description: This page explains the process (or processes) by which the design system gets updated and how others can contribute to it

---

## People

Describe who's involved in changes to the system. Describe who's expected to do the work and who approves changes.

## Process

Describe specifically the process or processes by which the system gets [updated](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#making-changes-to-patterns). What happens when existing patterns need to be modified? What if an entirely new pattern needs to be created? What happens if a pattern is deprecated? See [Canonical's fantastic decision tree](http://design.canonical.com/2016/07/getting-vanilla-ready-for-v1-the-roadmap/) for contributing changes to their design system.

Since a design system is made up of pattern code, guidelines, documentation, design tools, and resources, keep in mind you'll likely need to define several processes for contributing to each of these ingredients.

## Support

Cross-linking to the [support page]({{site.baseurl}}/support) is a good idea here.
