description: Guidelines for organizing files within the design system's repos

---

Use this section to explain how new projects should be structured or how files are organized within existing projects. Here would also be a good place to provide an overview of how production-ready files are structured and how users of the design system can integrate these files into their own projects. This info will obviously vary depending on your organization's environment(s).
