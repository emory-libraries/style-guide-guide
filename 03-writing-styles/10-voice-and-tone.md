Use this section to provide a complete style guide about the use of voice and tone when writing content.

## Voice

Voice is the personality or style of your writing—what sometimes is thought of as your attitude toward your audience. It helps you catch your readers’ attention and establish a relationship with them. Voice is important in the work we do, because it establishes consistency across a website or family of publications. The Emory essence is about inquisitiveness, optimism, impact, and purpose. The Emory Libraries voice echoes these sentiments.
 - Use a confident voice.
 - Use an active voice.
 - Be conversational.
 - Be concise, keeping your message direct and the length of your piece in check.

## Tone

Tone is a subset of your voice; it conveys the mood or attitude of each piece. If voice is the personality of your piece, then tone is the mood. Your tone will vary from piece to piece, but only within the consistent voice you have established.

### Tone Words

We have established a set of tone words that express the core traits of Emory Libraries and reflect its personality.
