Refer to the original and complete spec on the [Markdown Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) or pull from existing cheatsheets, like the ones offered by [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), [Github](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf), or the ever-popular [Github Wiki page by Adam Pritchard](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Remember that cheat sheets may vary depending on the flavor of Markdown used.
