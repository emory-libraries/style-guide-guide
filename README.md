# Emory Libraries Style Guide

> A style guide for Emory Libraries' websites

This style guide expresses the Emory Libraries' design system and includes patterns from Emory Libraries' [Pattern Library](https://github.com/emory-libraries/Pattern-Library).


## Prerequisites

This style guide was built using Brad Frost's [Style Guide Guide](https://github.com/bradfrost/style-guide-guide), which requires [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator. Jekyll is built on top of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and requires that Ruby 2.2.5 or greater be installed on your system and has been preloaded for use with [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).


## Installation

Prior to installation, ensure that all prerequisites have been met. Then, to install this project on your system:

1. Download and unzip the compressed package, or clone the repo using:

```
git clone https://github.com/emory-libraries/style-guide-guide
```

2. Then `cd` to your project's folder in a terminal and start the Jekyll server:

```
jekyll serve
```

> The Jekyll server will build the static site and watch for changes. To view the style guide and see live changes, visit `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in your browser.


## Getting Started

Use Jekyll's command line tools to generate the static site and make changes to the style guide:

- `jekyll build` - Builds the style guide and outputs it to a `_site` directory

- `jekyll serve` - Builds the style guide and starts a live server at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`, where it watches for changes in real-time.


## Using Jekyll

Jekyll is a versatile static site generator built with scalability and extensibility in mind. For more information on how to use it, refer to the [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) or review the [Jekyll Resources](https://jekyllrb.com/resources/) for additional tutorials, guides, and other helpful tools.

## Using Style Guide Guide

Brad Frost created Style Guide Guide as a quick and dirty way to build documentation for design systems based on his arguments about [workshops vs. storefronts](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-workshop-and-the-storefront/). It's intended to be used as a *storefront* for showcasing patterns from [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/), where Pattern Lab is the *workshop*.
